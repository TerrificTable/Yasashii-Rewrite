# Yasashii Client

a 1.12.2 Anarchy Client,
made by... well me for now

# Instalation
Eighter you download the .jar from the [releases](https://github.com/TerrificTable/Yasashii-Rewrite/releases)
or you can build it yourself

# Building the client
To build this (and other Buildable Client src's) is:
git clone the repository:

``` git clone https://github.com/TerrificTable/Yasashii-Rewrite ```

cd into the folder:

``` cd Yasashii-Rewrite ```

setup workspace:

``` gradlew ```

Build the Jar:

``` gradlew build ```

if you didnt got an error you should be having a folder caled: "build" inside the cloned repository
just open ./build/libs/ (inside the build folder should be a libs folder) then there should be a "Yasashii-Rewrite v.1.0.3.jar" inside that, just copy the file and put it inside your mod folder
